Setup HF:
	1. Logon to one of the HF and update the HF with a new token leave Index as Default (see pic)
	2. Update HF with new token
	3. Deploy HEC via DS
	4. Update the fleet file with new token and include all ssl certs (crt, key and ca) that matched with the server.conf (chain[crt & key], ca)
	5. Update SLB using SSL_TCP port 8088 - include the same cert (crt,key and ca) as steps 4

Note: 
For SSL_TCP_8088 - the cert on the SLB must match with the cert on the index servers and on splunk fleet.yml otherwise you'll will be SSL failed
For SSL_BRIDGE_8088 - the cert on the index servers must match with the cert on splunk fleet.yml otherwise you'll will be SSL failed 
     *** For DPE it needs to be SSL_BRIDGE_8088, currently we only have Web Cert for port 8000, the 8088 is using wildcard.domain.com i.e *.domain.com
